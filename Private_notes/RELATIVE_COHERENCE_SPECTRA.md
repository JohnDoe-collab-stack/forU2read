# Relative Coherence Spectra (multi-sentence closure invariant)

This note generalizes the binary “coherence spectrum closure” invariant to **finite families** of
sentences, making the object genuinely geometric:

```text
Spec^Coh_T(Φ) ⊆ {0,1}^n
```

It is designed to sit on top of `Private_notes/COHERENCE_SPECTRUM_CLOSURE.md`.

---

## 0. Setup (meta-level)

- `T` : a (classical) first-order theory.
- `Φ = {φ₁,…,φₙ}` : a **finite** family of **closed sentences** in the language of `T`.
- `Coh(U)` : a chosen meta-level coherence predicate.
- Working assumption (local, per target): `Spec^Coh_T(Φ) ≠ ∅` (spectrum inhabitation).

### Scope convention for `Coh`

We allow three regimes (exactly as in the binary note):

```text
(A) Coh := Con_syn

or

(B) Coh := Coh_C for a fixed semantic class C, where
    Coh_C(U) := “∃ M ∈ C such that M ⊨ U”

or

(C) Coh := an abstract coherence predicate, together with the specific stability properties
    explicitly invoked in each statement below.
```

In regime (C), we do **not** assume global completeness-style properties of `Coh`. We assume only:

```text
Spec^Coh_T(Φ) ≠ ∅
```

and, in protocol dynamics, `Spec^Coh_{T_t}(Φ) ≠ ∅` whenever we need the defect to stay in a fixed range.

### A canonical semantic choice (one fixed reference case)

To make the framework **portable** (not “just a parameterized schema”), it helps to fix one canonical
semantic coherence predicate as a reference point.

In this note, the reference case will be:

```text
C := the class of transitive models of ZFC
Coh_C(U) := “U has a transitive model”.
```

**Scope note.** This transitive-model reference case applies to set-theoretic theories in the
language of membership (or to theories interpreted in that language). For an arbitrary first-order
theory in an unrelated signature, one should choose a semantic class `C` of models for that
signature instead.

This choice is a standard reference semantic strengthening of syntactic consistency in set theory,
since it supports arithmetic absoluteness and yields a clean separation between semantic branch
admissibility and syntactic provability (see §7.1).

More explicitly, in this reference case we mean:

```text
Coh_C(U) := ∃ M (M is transitive, M ⊨ ZFC, and M ⊨ U).
```

So `Coh_C(U)` reads: “U is realized by a transitive ZFC-model.”

## 1. Branches for a family of sentences

Let:

```text
v ∈ {0,1}^n
```

be a Boolean valuation. Define the **branch theory fragment**:

```text
φᵢ^1 := φᵢ
φᵢ^0 := ¬φᵢ

Φ^v := { φᵢ^{vᵢ} : i = 1,...,n }.
```

and the extended theory:

```text
T + Φ^v.
```

For `n=1` (binary case), this recovers the previous definition:

```text
Spec^Coh_T(φ) ⊆ {0,1}.
```

---

## 2. The multi-sentence coherence spectrum

Define:

```text
Spec^Coh_T(Φ) := { v ∈ {0,1}^n : Coh(T + Φ^v) }.
```

This is the central object: an explicit subset of the Boolean cube. It encodes:

- which **global truth-branches** are `Coh`-admissible over `T`;
- how those branches correlate across coordinates.

---

## 3. Closure defect (multi-sentence)

Assume `Spec^Coh_T(Φ) ≠ ∅`. Define:

```text
D^Coh_T(Φ) := |Spec^Coh_T(Φ)| − 1.
```

Interpretation:

- **Closure on Φ**:
  ```text
  D^Coh_T(Φ) = 0
  ```
  iff **exactly one** global branch remains `Coh`-admissible:
  ```text
  |Spec^Coh_T(Φ)| = 1.
  ```

- **Openness on Φ**:
  ```text
  D^Coh_T(Φ) > 0
  ```
  iff **multiple** global branches remain `Coh`-admissible.

Maximally open case:

```text
Spec^Coh_T(Φ) = {0,1}^n
⇒
D^Coh_T(Φ) = 2^n − 1.
```

So:

```text
binary: D ∈ {0,1}
multi-sentence: D ∈ {0,…,2^n−1}.
```

---

## 4. Collapse theorem (syntactic consistency regime)

In regime (A), `Coh := Con_syn`, we have:

```text
Spec^Con_syn_T(Φ)
=
{ v ∈ {0,1}^n : Con_syn(T + Φ^v) }.
```

In the binary case `Φ={φ}`, under `Con_syn(T)`:

```text
D^Con_syn_T(φ)=0
⇔
T ⊢ φ  or  T ⊢ ¬φ.
```

So:

```text
Coh = Con_syn
⇒
binary spectral closure = syntactic decidability.
```

### Finite-family refinement (what collapses, exactly)

For finite `Φ`, the collapse is in fact **complete** (in the usual metatheory of classical first-order
logic):

```text
Assume Φ = {φ₁,…,φₙ} is finite and Con_syn(T).

Then Spec^Con_syn_T(Φ) = {v*}
iff
T syntactically decides every coordinate φᵢ, with truth-values given by v*:

  v*_i = 1 ⇒ T ⊢ φᵢ
  v*_i = 0 ⇒ T ⊢ ¬φᵢ.
```

**Proof sketch (⇒):** fix `i`. Suppose `v*_i = 1` but `T ⊬ φᵢ`. Then `T + ¬φᵢ` is syntactically
consistent (otherwise `T ⊢ ¬¬φᵢ` and classically `T ⊢ φᵢ`). By Lindenbaum’s lemma (existence of a
complete consistent extension), extend `T + ¬φᵢ` to a complete consistent theory `T'`. In particular,
for each `j ≠ i`, `T'` contains either `φⱼ` or `¬φⱼ`, yielding a valuation `w` with `w_i = 0` and
`T + Φ^w ⊆ T'`. Hence `Con_syn(T + Φ^w)`, so `w ∈ Spec^Con_syn_T(Φ)`, contradicting uniqueness.
The case `v*_i = 0` is symmetric.

**Proof sketch (⇐):** if `T` decides each `φᵢ`, then exactly one valuation matches those decisions and
every other valuation contradicts at least one decided coordinate, hence is inconsistent.

This is the precise sense in which the invariant becomes “trivial” in regime (A).

---

## 5. Semantic theorem (model-class regime)

In regime (B), fix a semantic class `C` and define:

```text
Coh_C(U) := ∃ M ∈ C, M ⊨ U.
```

Then:

```text
Spec^Coh_C_T(Φ)
=
{ v ∈ {0,1}^n : ∃ M ∈ C, M ⊨ (T + Φ^v) }.
```

Equivalently:

```text
Spec^Coh_C_T(Φ)
is exactly the set of Boolean truth-profiles of Φ
realized by C-admissible models of T.
```

For `n=1`, on the inhabited domain `Coh_C(T)`, closure becomes “truth forced relative to `C`”:

```text
Spec^Coh_C_T(φ) = {1}
⇔
every M ∈ C with M ⊨ T also satisfies φ,
```

and similarly for `{0}` (with `¬φ`).

---

## 6. Monotonicity (branch elimination under extension)

Assume **downward heredity** for `Coh`:

```text
If U ⊆ V and Coh(V), then Coh(U).
```

Then for theory extension:

```text
T ⊆ S
⇒
Spec^Coh_S(Φ) ⊆ Spec^Coh_T(Φ).
```

Proof (one line):

```text
v ∈ Spec^Coh_S(Φ)
⇒ Coh(S+Φ^v)
⇒ Coh(T+Φ^v)
⇒ v ∈ Spec^Coh_T(Φ).
```

So:

```text
extension of theory = elimination of branches.
```

In a protocol chain:

```text
T₀ ⊆ T₁ ⊆ T₂ ⊆ …
```

we get a descending chain:

```text
Spec^Coh_{T₀}(Φ) ⊇ Spec^Coh_{T₁}(Φ) ⊇ Spec^Coh_{T₂}(Φ) ⊇ …
```

and therefore (on the inhabited domain):

```text
D^Coh_{T₀}(Φ) ≥ D^Coh_{T₁}(Φ) ≥ D^Coh_{T₂}(Φ) ≥ …
```

---

## 7. A canonical separation example (semantic closure ≠ syntactic decision)

This section exhibits the phenomenon that motivates the whole construction:

```text
semantic branch closure can strictly refine syntactic decidability.
```

Let:

```text
T := ZFC
C := the class of transitive models of ZFC
Coh_C(U) := “U has a transitive model”
```

Assume `Coh_C(ZFC)` (i.e. there exists a transitive model of ZFC).

### 7.1 Separation theorem (clean statement with explicit meta-assumptions)

Let:

```text
T := ZFC
φ := Con_ZFC
```

Here `Con_ZFC` denotes a **closed sentence in the language of set theory** expressing the
arithmetized consistency of ZFC, e.g.:

```text
Con_ZFC := ¬Prov_ZFC(⌜⊥⌝).
```

Assume the following meta-level hypotheses:

```text
(H1) Coh_C(ZFC) holds, i.e. there exists a transitive model of ZFC.
(H2) Con_ZFC is a standard Hilbert–Bernays–Löb arithmetized consistency sentence for ZFC,
     so, since (H1) implies Con_syn(ZFC), Gödel II yields: ZFC ⊬ Con_ZFC.
```

Then:

```text
Spec^Coh_C_ZFC(Con_ZFC) = {1}
and
Spec^Con_syn_ZFC(Con_ZFC) = {0,1}.
```

Equivalently:

```text
D^Coh_C_ZFC(Con_ZFC) = 0
but
D^Con_syn_ZFC(Con_ZFC) = 1.
```

This is the canonical separation pattern:

```text
semantic Coh-closure  ≠  syntactic decision.
```

### Claim (semantic closure in the transitive-model regime)

```text
Spec^Coh_C_ZFC(Con_ZFC) = {1}.
```

Reason (meta-level): if `M` is a transitive model of ZFC, then `ω^M = ω` is standard, so arithmetical
truth about “finite proof codes” is absolute to `M`. In particular, `M ⊨ Con_ZFC`. Therefore every
transitive model `M ⊨ ZFC` satisfies `Con_ZFC`, hence no transitive model `M ⊨ ZFC + ¬Con_ZFC` exists.
On the other hand, `M` witnesses that `ZFC + Con_ZFC` is `Coh_C`-admissible.

### Contrast (syntactic openness under Gödel II)

Under the usual hypotheses (e.g. `Con_syn(ZFC)` and sufficient arithmetic strength), Gödel’s second
incompleteness theorem yields:

```text
ZFC ⊬ Con_ZFC.
```

So:

```text
semantic closure relative to C
≠
syntactic decision by T.
```

To make the separation fully explicit as a spectrum comparison, one can also record the
syntactic-consistency spectrum under the usual meta-hypotheses on ZFC (e.g. `Con_syn(ZFC)` and
sufficient arithmetic strength for Gödel II):

```text
Spec^Con_syn_ZFC(Con_ZFC) = {0,1},
```

i.e. both `ZFC + Con_ZFC` and `ZFC + ¬Con_ZFC` are syntactically consistent at the meta level.

Sketch: (i) `Coh_C(ZFC)` implies `Con_syn(ZFC + Con_ZFC)` since a transitive model of `ZFC` satisfies
`Con_ZFC`. (ii) `Con_syn(ZFC + ¬Con_ZFC)` holds since otherwise `ZFC ⊢ Con_ZFC`, contradicting Gödel II
under the usual hypotheses.

Thus the canonical separation takes the crisp form:

```text
Spec^Con_syn_ZFC(Con_ZFC) = {0,1}
but
Spec^Coh_C_ZFC(Con_ZFC)   = {1},
```

so:

```text
D^Con_syn_ZFC(Con_ZFC) = 1
but
D^Coh_C_ZFC(Con_ZFC)   = 0.
```

This is the canonical separation pattern the spectrum is built to capture.

---

## 8. Coordinate-wise openness/closure (geometry beyond cardinality)

The full subset:

```text
Spec^Coh_T(Φ) ⊆ {0,1}^n
```

is a strictly richer invariant than its cardinality. One simple refinement is coordinate openness.

Coordinate `i` is **Coh-closed** iff all spectrum points agree on it:

```text
i is closed ⇔ ∃ b ∈ {0,1}, ∀ v ∈ Spec^Coh_T(Φ), vᵢ = b.
```

Coordinate `i` is **Coh-open** iff both values occur:

```text
∃ v,w ∈ Spec^Coh_T(Φ) with vᵢ = 0 and wᵢ = 1.
```

Two spectra may have the same `D` but very different geometry, e.g.:

```text
Spec₁ = {000, 111}
Spec₂ = {000, 001}
```

Both have `|Spec|=2` hence `D=1`, but:

```text
Spec₁ : all coordinates vary together.
Spec₂ : exactly one coordinate varies.
```

So the “true” invariant is the spectrum subset itself; `D` is just the first numeric summary.

---

## 9. Spectral dependencies (“relative logical correlation”)

The spectrum also encodes dependencies between sentences, relative to `Coh`.

For two sentences `(φ, ψ)`:

- If:
  ```text
  Spec^Coh_T(φ, ψ) = {00, 11}
  ```
  then `φ` and `ψ` always share the same value on `Coh`-admissible branches.

- If:
  ```text
  Spec^Coh_T(φ, ψ) = {01, 10}
  ```
  then they always have opposite values on `Coh`-admissible branches.

- If:
  ```text
  Spec^Coh_T(φ, ψ) = {00, 01, 10, 11}
  ```
  then `φ` and `ψ` vary freely relative to `Coh` over `T` (i.e. all joint truth-profiles are
  `Coh`-admissible).

So `Spec^Coh_T(Φ)` induces a notion of “relative correlation” between statements.

---

## 10. Order-theoretic (functorial) view

Let `Th` be the poset of theories ordered by extension:

```text
T ≤ S  ⇔  T ⊆ S.
```

Fix `Φ`. Then:

```text
T ↦ Spec^Coh_T(Φ)
```

Assuming **downward heredity** for `Coh`:

```text
If U ⊆ V and Coh(V), then Coh(U),
```

the assignment is contravariant:

```text
T ⊆ S  ⇒  Spec^Coh_S(Φ) ⊆ Spec^Coh_T(Φ).
```

So we get an order functor:

```text
Spec^Coh_Φ : Th^op → (P({0,1}^n), ⊆).
```

Conceptually:

```text
as the theory grows, the Coh-admissible region of the Boolean cube contracts.
```

---

## 11. Paper-ready statement (template)

```text
Theorem (Relative Coherence Spectrum Closure).

Let T be a classical first-order theory, let Φ = {φ₁,…,φₙ} be a finite family of closed sentences,
and let Coh be either:

(i) Con_syn,
(ii) Coh_C for a fixed semantic class C of structures, or
(iii) an abstract coherence predicate with downward heredity and local spectrum inhabitation.

Assume local inhabitation:

    Spec^Coh_T(Φ) ≠ ∅.

For monotonicity, assume downward heredity of Coh:

    U ⊆ V and Coh(V) ⇒ Coh(U).

Define:
    Spec^Coh_T(Φ) = { v ∈ {0,1}^n : Coh(T + Φ^v) }.

Then:

1) (Monotonicity) If T ⊆ S, then Spec^Coh_S(Φ) ⊆ Spec^Coh_T(Φ).
2) (Closure) |Spec^Coh_T(Φ)| = 1 characterizes Coh-closure on Φ.
3) (Openness) |Spec^Coh_T(Φ)| > 1 characterizes Coh-openness on Φ.
4) (Collapse) For Coh = Con_syn and finite Φ, closure on Φ coincides with syntactic decision
   of every coordinate φᵢ by T. (Assume Con_syn(T) in this regime.)
5) (Separation) There exist natural stronger semantic coherence predicates Coh (e.g. transitive-model
   coherence) for which Coh-closure strictly refines syntactic decidability.
```
